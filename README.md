# Hello-world
Big Ideas Collaboration
Our program takes a name and a vowel in that name. It then removes the vowel from the name, replacing it with a space, and prints the new name.
Then we count the amount of vowels in the new name and print that number to the user.

We decided to go with pythons CoC since that's the language our program is written in. The python CoC also has a lot of details that we really agree with and they touch on keeping things professional and fear for every kind of person.

Python Software Foundation License(PSFL)

We decided to choose Python Software Foundation License(PSFL) for our license because it is a python license as indicated by the name and that is the language in which our program was written. Our program is also a basic program directed towards users with little to no experience in coding. Allowing new users to alter the program in anyway can give them a small program to start with where they can then make any changes they want to test out some ideas they have.

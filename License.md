Python Software Foundation License(PSFL)

We decided to choose this license because it is a python license as indicated by the name and that is the language in which our program was written. Our program is also a basic program directed towards users with little to no experience in coding. Allowing new users to alter the program in anyway can give them a small program to start with where they can then make any changes they want to test out some ideas they have.
